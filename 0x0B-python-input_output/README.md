# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.3.0`
* C files are written according to the standard `C89 with GNU extensions`
* Shell scripts tested using `bash`
* Python interpreter `python3 version 3.8.5`
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Tasks
The following files are python scripts, shell scripts and functions in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-read_file.py` | Function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout. |
| `1-write_file.py` | Function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written. |
| `2-append_write.py` | function that appends a string at the end of a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added. |
| `3-to_json_string.py` | Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string). |
| `4-from_json_string.py` | Function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string). |
| `5-save_to_json_file.py` | Function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation. |
| `6-load_from_json_file.py` | Function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”. |
| `7-add_item.py` | Script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file. |
| `8-class_to_json.py` | Function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object. |
| `9-student.py` | class Student that defines a student by: Public instance attributes: `first_name`, `last_name`, `age` Instantiation with `first_name`, `last_name` and `age`: `def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):` Public method `def to_json(self):` that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as `8-class_to_json.py`). |
| `10-student.py` | Class Student that defines a student by: (based on `9-student.py`). |
| `11-student.py` | Class Student that defines a student by: (based on `10-student.py`). |
| `12-pascal_triangle.py` | Function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n. |
| `100-append_after.py` | Function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string. |
| `101-stats.py` | Script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics. |
